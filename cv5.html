	<h3>My mom is named Wendy and she is currently 49. She is an extremely hard worker and has had to work a lot during my childhood. 
	She is as big of a lover of dogs as I am. She also loves candy and Mountain Dew. </h3>

	<h3>My mom's boyfriend's name is Juan Torres. He is basically my father figure and has been since the beginning of high school. 
	He went through chemo last year and has a bone marrow transplant in February. He is a very hard worker also and never complains. 
	He did not complain once going through his awful treatments. His hobbies include watching Netflix and fishing. </h3>
	
	<h3>My sister is named Elizabeth. She is currently 22 and goes to the University of Maine also. We are very different people but we are still close. 
	She is a vegetarian and loves to garden. Both of which I would hate to do. </h3>

	<h3>My brother is named Linwood. He is currently 24 and works in Buckfield. We never really got along as kids and we aren't very close.
	He enjoys playing video games, fixing his car, and cooking weird foods. </h3>
