	<h2> I moved into Somerset Hall in the fall of 2016. I'm currently a sophomore with junior credits. </h2>
	
	<h2>Originally I came in with my major being Biochemistry but 3 days in I switched. I then switched to History and Political Science
	just to get out of an awful lab. I've learned I don't enjoy labs. The end of my first semester I switched again to accounting. Which 
	I actually really enjoy considering it is great for people with minor OCD. </h2>
	
	<h2>I lived in Somerset Hall but I was really never there between going home and being at my boyfriends apartment. The first week of classes
	at UMaine I found out my mom's boyfriend had Stage 4 Mantle Cell Lymphoma. This made my first year difficult considering I went home 
	every weekend to help my mom. I also drove to Boston countless times for his appointments because my mom had to work. Luckily after very 
	strong chemo and a bone marrow transplant in Boston last February he is cancer FREE. </h2>
	
	<h2>While I was around on campus I had a roommate named Sarah. She was great and we got along very well which made it easier when I was around. </h2> 
	
	<h2>Even though my first year was a struggle with family health I ended the year with a 3.5 GPA and I hope to keep it that way. Currently 
	I am trying to keep a 3.5 or higher and graduating in four years with 150 credits. One day I hope to become a CPA.</h2> 
	
	<h2>I'm very excited to continue my education and make more memories. </h2>
