	<h3> I was the last born of three kids. So basically I was the spoiled brat that siblings always hate. I was born on Augusta 24, 1998.
	My due date was much earlier but I was a stubborn kid. My mother had to have a c-section with me because we had blood match issues. 
	The doctors were surprised that she already had two kids and my mom wasn't allowed to have anymore. I like to say that I was just so perfect that her body knew it and
	there was no reason for another kid. <h3/>
	

	<h3> My childhood wasn't all rainbows and sunshine though. My parents got divorced when I was going into second grade. I didn't really understand it at the time. 
	All I knew was my parents weren't living together anymore and I was moving a lot. In the long run though I'm glad it happened. Around second grade was when I started going to my 
	grandmothers a lot. I started working for them because they own a honeybee company. And no I don't mean like working/playing. I mean basically doing whatever she told me to do like vacuum, dishes,
	extract, carry jars, etc. Way more than a child my age should have to do. <h3/>
	
	<h3> This was also the time I started playing sports which is a hobby for me. I was also extremely tall for my age by the time I hit the third grade. This made sports a lot easier for me considering I had about a foot on everyone. <h3/>
