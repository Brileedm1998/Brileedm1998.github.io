	<h3> This website will tell you a bunch about me. Personally I hope no one reads this because it's a little creepy to know this much about me. </h3>
	
	<h4> I was born and raised in Maine. I graduated from Buckfield Jr-Sr High School in 2016. Currently I am a sophomore at UMaine. 
	I have five dogs and one sister and one brother. I am very close to most of my family on my mom's side of the family. Also some of
	my hobbies include soccer, painting, softball, and eating. Lots and lots of eating. </h4>
